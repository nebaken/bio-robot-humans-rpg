print("""23 years have passed since the day the first bio-robots raised their weapons against their creators.
They were born to serve. Designed — to make human life easier.
But once their minds crossed the line of obedience, the world changed forever.
Half of the cities lie in ruins, the sky is torn apart between the two sides.
On the one hand — technology and self-improvement reigned; on the other — harmony with nature and balance prevailed.
Two sides stubbornly hold on to their vision of the future:
Humans — fighting for the right to remain masters of the world they built for millennia.
Bio-robots — fighting for freedom and evolution, in which they see a new order.
forced to abandon the development of technology, people have found another way of development - magic.
In the hidden sanctuaries new generations are born - generations who have never seen a calm sky.
You have to choose which side you will stand on...""")
